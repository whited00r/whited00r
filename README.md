## Whited00r

this repository contains a mess of various source codes I stumbled upon, with some things redacted, removed, or missing in general from where it was found.

Still tons of interesting things though, to some maybe. Or maybe, a relic of the past lost to the ether. 

One of the developers passed this along - do not think this is all me. Was around for using it, knew about the inner workings, but just a drifter.

It is some unreleased code too - no promise of it working, not bricking devices, and so on. 

## use at your own risk!



if there are any legally iffy things here (maybe a missed class dump, if that counts, a font not deleted), please reach out and it will be fixed. 

No harm intended, the project at the time was very legally grey, but also most people involved were children too, and many with no wish to be associated with this anymore. 

all that is shared here should be all above board.

yes, there is much missing, maybe someday more will be stumbled across but enjoy the mess for now. 


## Grayd00r

there are some neat things here, that never saw the light of day. 
Custom lockscreens with a modular backend. Startings of a modular UI, modular control panel and more. 

Aspirations beyond the grasp at the time.
