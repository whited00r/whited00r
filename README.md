## Whited00r

make no mistake, this is shit code.  It got better towards grayd00r, but still shit.

this repository contains a mess of various source codes I stumbled upon, while reaching out to some people from the project.

Some things redacted, removed, or missing in general from where it was found.

Still tons of interesting things though, to some maybe. Or maybe, a relic of the past lost to the ether. 

One of the developers passed this along - do not think this is mine. Was around for using it, knew about the inner workings, but just a drifter.

It is some unreleased code too - no promise of it working, not bricking devices, and so on. 

## use at your own risk!



if there are any legally iffy things here (maybe a missed class dump, if that counts, a font not deleted), please reach out and it will be fixed. 

No harm intended, the project at the time was legally grey for parts of it, but also most people involved were children too (explanation, not excuse), and many with no wish to be associated with this anymore. 

all that is shared here should be all above board.

yes, there is much missing, maybe someday more will be stumbled across but enjoy the mess for now. 


## Grayd00r

there are some neat things here, that never saw the light of day. 
Custom lockscreens with a modular backend. Startings of a modular UI, modular control panel and more. 

Aspirations beyond the grasp at the time.


## issues

look, this will never get touched again by me. Merely a messenger, or remover of any lingering files that should not be here. 

Submit them, but it will be to no use. Fork it and maintain it.  This is just for history at this point.
